Task Tracker
======

This is a project purely for me to learn about front-end development using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/). The code touches on things like 2-way data binding and Angular directives. It is essentially a task tracking list with countdown timer and alerts. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is used for some of the HTML, CSS elements.
